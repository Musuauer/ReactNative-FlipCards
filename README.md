# FlipCards

A React-Native mobile app using Redux to handle data.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

This mobile app presents the user with a list of decks to study several topics. Each deck contains a number of cards, which can be flipped to view the answer. 

The user can asses his/her knowledge based on the hidden answers and make a self-evaluation by answering a quiz, which display the results at the end of it. There's also the option to add a new deck and to add new cards to each deck.
